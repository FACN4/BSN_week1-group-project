        <p> Team G-force met at Founders & Coders and since then G-Force is the most
           powerful team of web developers. The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest
           cat species, most recognizable for its pattern of dark vertical stripes on
           reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the
           genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard.
           It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and
            bovids. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator,
             often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support its prey
             requirements. This, coupled with the fact that it is indigenous to some
             of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.
